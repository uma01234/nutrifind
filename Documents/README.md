## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
- A basic understanding of Python and Flask.
- An API key and application ID for the **Edamam API**.

### Setting Up the Project
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd NutriFind
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Obtain your **Edamam API Key**:
   - Go to the [Edamam API website](https://developer.edamam.com/) and sign up.
   - Create a new application to get your `APP_ID` and `APP_KEY`.

6. Create a `keys.py` file in the project root to store your API credentials:
   ```python
   # keys.py
   app_id = "your_app_id_here"
   app_key = "your_app_key_here"
   ```

---

## Running the Application
1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python runapp.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## How to Use NutriFind

### Step 1: Enter Ingredients
- On the homepage, enter one or more ingredients (e.g., "salmon, butter") in the input field.
- You can enter ingredients separated by commas or spaces (e.g., `eggs, butter` or `eggs butter`).

### Step 2: Select Dietary Restrictions
- Use the dropdown to select one or more dietary restrictions (e.g., Vegan, Gluten-Free).
- Hold the `Ctrl` key (or `Cmd` on Mac) to select multiple options.

### Step 3: View Results
- Click "Search" to view the results.
- The results page displays:
  - **Recipe Name**: Title of the recipe.
  - **Meal Type**: e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner.
  - **Calories**: Rounded to the nearest whole number.
  - **Dietary Labels**: Dietary restrictions that apply to the recipe.
  - **Ingredients**: A detailed list of ingredients.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Fixes
1. **API Key Error**: If you see an error indicating invalid credentials:
   - Double-check your `keys.py` file to ensure the `app_id` and `app_key` values are correct.
   - Ensure your API key has not expired or exceeded its quota.

2. **No Results for Filters**:
   - If you apply dietary restrictions and see recipes that donâ€™t match, ensure the filters align with your expectations.
   - Check the `healthLabels` section in the recipe details for matching criteria.

3. **Ingredient Formatting**:
   - Ensure ingredients are entered correctly. If you enter "salmon butter," it will automatically format to "salmon,butter."

4. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - If you get errors about missing Python packages, ensure you ran:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Limitations and Known Issues
- Recipes might still appear if they partially match dietary filters. This is dependent on the Edamam API's filtering.
- The calorie information is rounded but might still vary slightly due to API data precision.
- Multiple filters are applied conjunctively (i.e., all must match).

---

## Future Improvements
- Add pagination for large result sets.
- Display preparation and cooking times (if available from the API).
- Improve ingredient parsing for more natural input (e.g., "3 eggs and butter").
